# Description:
This repository contains code and data used for the application of machine learning models to predict the Initial Discharge Capacity (IC) and Cycled Discharge Capacity (CC) of the LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (LNMO) cathode using a dataset consisting of 145 experimental trials. This is given as supplementary material for the manuscript "Application of Machine Learning for Enhanced LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Cathode Optimisation".
